# library
Simple library web app that allows the user to add books, keep track of their books, mark them as read or remove them.

The main purpose was to get a little more familiar with object constructors and TailwindCSS, as this was the first time I used either.

### Technologies used
- Vanilla HTML/JS
- TailwindCSS
